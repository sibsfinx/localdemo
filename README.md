## Development

Development enviroment runs with
[Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/getting-started/) â€” Sinatra-based
app that generates static websites.

`bundle install` first.

`bundle exec middleman` starts a server on `0.0.0.0:4567` (livereload
included)*.

`bundle exec middleman build` builds a static site in `www` folder
(configurable).

Install [livereload browser extensions](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-)

## Local data and content

Middleman uses `front matter` for accessing data stored in `yml` and
`json` files. 

`models` folder contains sample ruby models. They are unused currently, 
but feel free to use them if you need.

For example, data is stored in `data` folder in .yml files.

Access data in templates with `= data.yml_file.key...` objects, like `= data.projects.first.title`
